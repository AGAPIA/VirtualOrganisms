B. See below explanations and on screen messages

Manual for step by step simulation from file.

In the input file give one of the following commands:
E							// Simulates g_simulationTicksForDataFlowEstimation ticks (Variable defiend in config.ini)
R							// Reorganize
S row column R				//  Removes a source. E.g. S 2 4 R => removes source located at row 2 column 4
S row column M newPower		// Modifies the source located at row column to have a new specified power
S row column A power		// Adds a source with the specified location and power 
P							// Prints current board

You can see the output of the execution in  in results.txt

Others, not so important options when simulating for a file:
O							// Reorganize and run g_simulationTicksForDataFlowEstimation - to see how it affects the flow
Q							// exit
U							// Undo
S fileName					// Saves the current board in a file for further debugging
